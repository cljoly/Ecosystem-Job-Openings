## [Clearmatics](https://www.clearmatics.com/careers) is hiring! 


### What we're building

Founded in 2015, [Clearmatics](https://www.clearmatics.com/careers) is a London-based blockchain R&D company, whose mission is to build peer-to-peer infrastructures that solve issues and inefficiencies inherent to today's client-server architectures.

With a special focus on capital markets, we work with firms that have the ambition to reinvent the industry's business models.

In order to drive adoption of a next-generation market infrastructure, we build blockchain systems called "Decentralised Clearing Networks" (DCNs).

DCNâ€™s are private, member-owned and governed networks that enable peer-to-peer transfer of financial value and automation of contractual and fiduciary operations without reliance on trusted third-parties.We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation market infrastructure where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum.

We are driven to disrupt legacy market structures, and focus our efforts on building a network of interoperable DCNs that ultimately will lead to a more efficient, transparent, ethic, and robust financial market infrastructure. Our technology combines cryptography, consensus protocols and network economics. Current areas of research include interoperability, consensus, network economics and privacy.


Clearmatics is a company with a strong belief in the open source movement and good ties to the Ethereum community. We also work closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and are an active member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA).
